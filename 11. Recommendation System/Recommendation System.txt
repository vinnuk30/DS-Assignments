Recommendation System

Data Description:

Unique ID of each anime.
Anime title.
Anime broadcast type, such as TV, OVA, etc.
anime genre.
The number of episodes of each anime.
The average rating for each anime compared to the number of users who gave ratings.


Number of community members for each anime.
Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to implement a recommendation system using cosine similarity on an anime dataset. 
Dataset:
Use the Anime Dataset which contains information about various anime, including their titles, genres,No.of episodes and user ratings etc.

Tasks:

Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset into a suitable data structure (e.g., pandas DataFrame).
Handle missing values, if any.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and attributes.

Feature Extraction:

Decide on the features that will be used for computing similarity (e.g., genres, user ratings).
Convert categorical features into numerical representations if necessary.
Normalize numerical features if required.

Recommendation System:

Design a function to recommend anime based on cosine similarity.
Given a target anime, recommend a list of similar anime based on cosine similarity scores.
Experiment with different threshold values for similarity scores to adjust the recommendation list size.

Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluate the recommendation system using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyze the performance of the recommendation system and identify areas of improvement.

Interview Questions:
1. Can you explain the difference between user-based and item-based collaborative filtering?
Answer:
User-based collaborative filtering:
- This approach recommends items by finding similar users.
- It first identifies users who are similar to the target user based on their interactions with items (e.g., ratings).
- Then, it recommends items that similar users have liked or interacted with but the target user has not.
For example, if User A and User B have similar preferences and User A has liked an item that User B has not interacted with, the system might recommend that item to User B.

Item-based collaborative filtering:
- This approach recommends items that are similar to items the user has liked or interacted with in the past.
- It first calculates the similarity between items based on user interactions.
- Then, it recommends items that are similar to those the user has liked in the past.
For example, if User A liked Item X, and Item Y is similar to Item X, the system might recommend Item Y to User A.

2. What is collaborative filtering, and how does it work?
Answer:
- Collaborative filtering is a technique used by recommender systems to make automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating).
- It works by searching for patterns in the preferences of multiple users to recommend items or content that users with similar preferences have liked in the past.
- The main idea is to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item based on the ratings or preferences of other users.
- Collaborative filtering can be implemented using different approaches, including user-based and item-based methods, as well as more complex models such as matrix factorization and deep learning.
